MUDGPT is a new genre of games that combines the traditional elements of Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) with the power of pre-trained transformer language models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). In MUDGPT, players enter a virtual world consisting of chat rooms where they can interact with each other and with computer-generated characters.
The game's content is generated in real-time using a collaboration between users and the GPT language model. Players can give cues to the AI model to generate locations, quests, and characters based on their interests, preferences, and gameplay style. The AI then generates content based on these cues and presents them to the players, creating a unique and dynamic gameplay experience.
MUDGPT is designed to be a collaborative and immersive experience, where players can work together to solve puzzles, battle enemies, and explore new worlds. The game is not limited by the imagination of the game developers, as the AI can generate an endless array of possibilities based on the cues given by the players.
Overall, MUDGPT represents a new frontier in gaming, where the power of AI and human collaboration can create truly unique and engaging experiences for players.
